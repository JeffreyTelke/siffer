= Siffer  -  h3o(software) SIF Implementation

== Welcome to Siffer

This is the h3o(software) implementation of the SIF (School Interoperability 
Framework) in Ruby. The project is Ruby based and includes all of the SIF 
infrastructure (Data Model, Agents, Zone Integration Servers and even database 
stores). 

Siffer is a platform - not a development kit. Certainly it's open source and
you can take this code and do as you wish. However, Siffer provides out of the
box all the things you need to run a SIF environment. 

Simply put you can do one of two things with Siffer:

1) You can download it and run the admin server and setup Servers and Agents. 
2) You can download it and write the code to build your own Servers and Agents.


It's currently incomplete - Stay Tuned!

== Goal

The overriding goal of this project is to provide anyone in the education 
industry a quick, easy and simple SIF implementation tool. 

== Philosophy 

Remove the complexity from the implementation. Make the execution and 
deployment of SIF easy. 

Make SIF more REST'ful. As much as possible expose the actions and data models
through the URI and URL of ZIS and Agent components.

Make SIF more useful. As much as possible remove the "XML" and "Database" 
questions out of the equation. 

Make it simple. Make it easy. Make it fun. Make it intuitive. 
Make it do exactly what needs to be done.
You're too busy for anything else.
