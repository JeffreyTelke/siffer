= Siffer  -  h3o(software) SIF Implementation

== Welcome to Siffer

This is the h3o(software) implementation of the SIF (School Interoperability 
Framework) in Ruby. The project is Ruby based and includes all of the SIF 
infrastructure (Data Model, Agents, Zone Integration Servers and even database 
stores). 


It's currently incomplete - Stay Tuned!

== Goal

The overriding goal of this project is to provide anyone in the education 
industry a quick, easy and simple SIF implementation tool. 

== Philosophy 

Remove the complexity from the implementation. Make the execution and 
deployment of SIF easy. 

Make SIF more REST'ful. As much as possible expose the actions and data models
through the URI and URL of ZIS and Agent components.

== Implementation Information (sifinfo.org)

This implementation is based on version 2.3 of the SIF Specification.
It can be found here: http://specification.sifinfo.org/Implementation/2.3/
