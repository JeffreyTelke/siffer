= Project: Siffer  -  h3o(software) SIF Implementation

== Welcome to Siffer

This is the h3o(software) implementation of the SIF (School Interoperability 
Framework) in Ruby. The project is Ruby based and includes all of the SIF 
infrastructure (Data Model, Agents, Zone Integration Servers and even database 
stores). 

== Goal

The overriding goal of this project is to provide anyone in the education 
industry a quick, easy and small SIF implementation tool. Sane Defaults in front
of easy Configurations.

=== Setup and Deployment

Siffer is easy to install and setup. Zone Integration Servers and Agents can be 
created at the command line. Zone Integration Servers are managed by web based 
interfaces and Agents will be centrally managed by a web based interface. 
Administrators will be able to manage all components of their deployment from 
a browser.

== Philosophy 

Remove the complexity from the implementation. Make the execution and 
deployment of SIF easy.

== Implementation Information (sifinfo.org)

This implementation is based on version 2.2 of the SIF Specification. The 
Specification is in {PDF}[link:../SIF%20ImplementationSpecification.pdf] format 
inside the doc folder.
